            <strong>Influenza</strong>, commonly known as "the flu", is an
            infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms range from
            mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat,
            muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. These symptoms begin
            from one to four days after exposure to the virus (typically two
            days) and last for about 2–8 days. Diarrhea and vomiting can occur,
            particularly in children. Influenza may progress to pneumonia, which
            can be caused by the virus or by a subsequent bacterial infection.
            Other complications of infection include acute respiratory distress
            syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and worsening of pre-existing
            health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.
            <br />
            There are four types of influenza virus, termed influenza viruses A,
            B, C, and D. Aquatic birds are the primary source of Influenza A
            virus (IAV), which is also widespread in various mammals, including
            humans and pigs. Influenza B virus (IBV) and Influenza C virus (ICV)
            primarily infect humans, and Influenza D virus (IDV) is found in
            cattle and pigs. IAV and IBV circulate in humans and cause seasonal
            epidemics, and ICV causes a mild infection, primarily in children.
            IDV can infect humans but is not known to cause illness. In humans,
            influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory
            droplets produced from coughing and sneezing. Transmission through
            aerosols and intermediate objects and surfaces contaminated by the
            virus also occur.

            The time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms,
            called the incubation period, is 1–4 days, most commonly 1–2 days.
            Many infections, however, are asymptomatic.[8] The onset of symptoms
            is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific,
            including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling
            of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and
            confusion. These symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory
            symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and
            a stuffy or runny nose. Coughing is the most common symptom.
            Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea,
            vomiting, diarrhea,and gastroenteritis,especially in children. The
            standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2–8 days.A 2021 study
            suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way
            to long COVID.
            <br />
            Symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper
            respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively
            common. Pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or by
            a secondary bacterial infection. Primary pneumonia is characterized
            by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing, and low
            oxygen levels that cause bluish skin. It is especially common among
            those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as
            rheumatic heart disease. Secondary pneumonia typically has a period
            of improvement in symptoms for 1–3 weeks[13] followed by recurrent
            fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs,but can
            also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear. About a
            third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary
            pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria
            Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus.

            Diagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy
            people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of

            encephalitis, myocarditis, or breaking down of muscle tissue

            Influenza viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone
            with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the
            droplets directly. Or you can pick up the germs from an object —
            such as a telephone or computer keyboard — and then transfer them to
            your eyes, nose or mouth. People with the virus are likely
            contagious from about a day before symptoms appear until about four
            days after they start. Children and people with weakened immune
            systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza
            viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing
            regularly. If you've had influenza in the past, your body has
            already made antibodies to fight that specific strain of the virus.
            If future influenza viruses are similar to those you've encountered
            before, either by having the disease or by getting vaccinated, those
            antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity. But
            antibody levels may decline over time. Also, antibodies against
            influenza viruses you've encountered in the past may not protect you
            from new influenza strains. New strains can be very different
            viruses from what you had before.

            <h4>Vaccination</h4>
            <p>
              Annual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to
              prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications,
              especially for high-risk groups.Vaccines against the
              flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an
              H1N1 strain, an H3N2 strain, and one or two IBV strains
              corresponding to the two IBV lineages.Two types of vaccines
              are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain "killed" (i.e.
              inactivated) viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines
              (LAIVs) that contain weakened viruses.There are three types of
              inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus
              is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the
              viral antigens HA and NA.Most flu vaccines are inactivated
              and administered via intramuscular injection. LAIVs are sprayed
              into the nasal cavity.
              <br />
              Vaccination recommendations vary by country. Some recommend
              vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6
              months,whereas other countries recommendation is limited for
              high at risk groups, such as pregnant women, young children
              (excluding newborns), the elderly, people with chronic medical
              conditions, health care workers,people who come into contact
              with high-risk people, and people who transmit the virus
              easily.Young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety
              reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother
              if inactivated vaccines are administered to the mother during
              pregnancy.Influenza vaccination also helps to reduce the
              probability of reassortment.
              <br />
              In general, influenza vaccines are only effective if there is an
              antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating
              strains.Additionally, most commercially available flu
              vaccines are manufactured by propagation of influenza viruses in
              embryonated chicken eggs, taking 6–8 months.Flu seasons are
              different in the northern and southern hemisphere, so the WHO
              meets twice a year, one for each hemisphere, to discuss which
              strains should be included in flu vaccines based on observation
              from HA inhibition assays.Other manufacturing methods
              include an MDCK cell culture-based inactivated vaccine and a
              recombinant subunit vaccine manufactured from baculovirus
              overexpression in insect cells.
