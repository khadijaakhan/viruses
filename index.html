            <strong> Virus</strong>, Microscopic, simple infectious agent that
            can multiply only in living cells of animals, plants, or bacteria.
            Viruses are much smaller than bacteria and consist of a single- or
            double-stranded nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein
            shell called a capsid; some viruses also have an outer envelope
            composed of lipids and proteins. They vary in shape. The two main
            classes are RNA viruses and DNA viruses. Outside of a living cell, a
            virus is an inactive particle, but within an appropriate host cell
            it becomes active, capable of taking over the cell’s metabolic
            machinery for the production of new virus particles (virions). Some
            animal viruses produce latent infections, in which the virus
            persists in a quiet state, becoming periodically active

            acute episodes, as in the case of the herpes simplex virus. An
            animal can respond to a viral infection in various ways, including
            fever, secretion of interferon, and attack by the immune system.
            Many human diseases, including influenza, the common cold, AIDS, and
            COVID-19, as well as many economically important plant and animal
            diseases, are caused by viruses. Successful vaccines have been
            developed to combat such viral diseases as measles, mumps,
            poliomyelitis, smallpox, and rubella. Drug therapy is generally not
            useful in controlling established viral infections, since drugs that
            inhibit viral development also inhibit the functions of the host
            cell.

            Viruses cannot replicate on their own, but rather depend on their
            host cell’s protein synthesis pathways to reproduce. This typically
            occurs by the virus inserting its genetic material in host cells,
            co-opting the proteins to create viral replicates, until the cell
            bursts from the high volume of new viral particles.
            <h3 class="mt-5">Main steps of viral replication</h3>
            <p class="mt-4">
              The replication cycle can be highly diverse between different
              species and categories of viruses. Despite this, there are
              generally six broad steps required for viral replication to occur
              successfully. These include attachment, penetration, uncoating,
              replication, assembly, and virion release.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              The first stage, attachment, involves viral proteins binding to
              the host cell surface. There, they interact with receptors
              specific to them and their host cells. The specificity of viral
              attachment is a key decider of the range of hosts a virus can
              affect. This is also known as the tropism of a virus.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Once attached to the surface, viruses can gain entry to the cell
              via the changes that occur after binding. Binding a specific
              receptor can lead to conformational changes in the proteins on the
              viral capsid that lead to the viral and cellular membranes fusing.
              While this is one of the most common methods of penetration, some
              DNA viruses can enter host cells through receptor-mediated
              endocytosis.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Once inside the cell, the first step is uncoating. This involves
              the viral capsid degrading, either by the action of viral or host
              enzymes. This releases the genomic information (mostly in RNA
              form, but can be in DNA form). This enables the start of
              replication through transcription or translation for RNA or DNA
              viral genomic information, respectively. The result of the
              replication step is the synthesis of the viral genome and
              proteins.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              The next step is assembly, in which the products of the
              replication step can be post-transcriptionally modified. The viral
              proteins and viral genome are then packed into new virions which
              can be released from the host cell. Assembly is also sometimes
              referred to as maturation.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              The release of virions from the host cell can occur via two main
              methods. The lysis method results in the death of the host cell
              and the viruses that do this are usually referred to as cytolytic
              viruses. An example of this is smallpox.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Viruses with envelopes are more commonly released by budding,
              allowing the virus to gain a viral phospholipid envelope. These
              viruses do not usually kill the host cell and are known as
              cytopathic viruses. Influence A virus is an example of a
              cytopathic virus.

            Viruses can be classified primarily on their phenotypic
            characteristics, core content, chemical composition, capsid
            structure, size, shape, modes of replication and other viral genome
            structures. The Baltimore classification is the most commonly used
            for studying the system of virus classification. This system was
            developed by an American biologist David Baltimore in the 1970s, for
            which he was awarded the Nobel Prize. The below virus information
            describes the classification of viruses based on their different
            criteria.

            classified into two Positive sense RNA (+RNA) and negative sense RNA
