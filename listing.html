            <p>
              The first account of the West Nile Virus in the U.S. was in New
              York City in the summer of 1999. The virus was transmitted by
              mosquito bites, concentrating in areas with warmer temperatures\;
              as the number of human cases grew, so did the number of bird
              deaths. During a three-year period, WNV spread to 44 states,
              amounting to 4,156 cases and 284 deaths. Typical symptoms include
              breaking out in high fever, a stiff neck and headaches, though
              most people who are infected do not show any symptoms unless the
              infection is serious. cell.

            <p>
              After 9/11, letters contaminated with white powder containing
              anthrax spores were delivered to a news media company and two U.S.
              Senators’ offices. The powder let the anthrax spores float in the
              air to be breathed in. The first diagnosed case came in October of
              2001, and climbed to a total of 22 cases and five deaths. The FBI
              led a nine-year investigation on how anthrax got in those letters,
              and concluded the powder came from a research lab.

              Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a viral respiratory illness
              caused by a coronavirus, was first diagnosed in Asia in February
              of 2003, later reaching the U.S. in that same year. Common
              symptoms included high fevers, coughing and shortness of breath. A
              total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick, with only eight of

              The U.S. saw multi-state outbreaks of mumps reporting more than
              6,500 cases in 2006, concentrating mainly in Midwestern college
              campuses. Mumps spread through close-contact activities such as
              sports, dancing, kissing, etc. From 2009 to 2010, the largest
              outbreak reported 3,000 cases in a close-knit religious community
              in New York City after an infected student returned from the UK
              where there was another outbreak. Notable symptoms include fever,
              puffy cheeks and a swollen, tender jaw.

            <p>
              Escherichia coli was first reported in the U.S. in 2006 through
              the contamination of fresh spinach, with 199 reported cases and
              three deaths within 26 states. The following year, Taco Bell was
              linked to E. coli cases in the northeastern area of the U.S. The
              contraction of E. coli can lead to the development of Hemolytic
              Uremic Syndrome and potentially kidney failure, while other
              notable symptoms are severe diarrhea and respiratory illnesses. In
              2008, 49 cases in multiple states were linked to consuming Kroger
              Beef and in 2009 raw cookie dough was the culprit. However, the
              most infamous outbreak occurred in 2015 where a total of 58 cases
              were reported in 14 states. In 2006, tomatoes were linked to
              Salmonella for a total of 183 cases in 21 states. The list of
              foods linked to salmonella ranged from cantaloupe, peanut butter,
              raw chicken to even pet food. In 2012, cases of Salmonella linked
              to small turtles led to a total of 473 cases in 43 states but no
              deaths reported. The most recent outbreaks have been reported from
              consumption of a specific brand of tahini in 2018. Common symptoms
              include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps.

              December and resulting in at least 12,220 deaths. The swine flu
              was transmitted by pigs as a respiratory disease, usually through

              weeks or more and can be life-threatening for infants. Worldwide,

              Ebola was found in Africa near the Ebola River in 1976, but the
              outbreak that recently caught the world’s attention started in
              Guinea before spreading to neighboring countries, with the highest
              cases in Sierra Leone of 14,124 and 3,956 deaths. Ebola reached
              the U.S. but only recorded four cases and one fatality, and in
              2015 the CDC announced a vaccine against the disease. The most
              recent outbreaks of Ebola occured in the Democratic Republic of
              Congo in 2018.
