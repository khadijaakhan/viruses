            <strong>Malaria</strong> is a mosquito-borne infectious
            disease that affects humans and other animals.Malaria causes
            symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and
            headaches.In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or
            death.Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten
            by an infected mosquito.If not properly treated, people may have
            recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently
            survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder
            symptoms.This partial resistance disappears over months to years if
            the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.

            Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium
            group.It is spread exclusively through bites of infected Anopheles
            mosquitoes.The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the
            mosquito's saliva into a person's blood.The parasites travel to the
            liver where they mature and reproduce.

            Adults with malaria tend to experience chills and fever –
            classically in periodic intense bouts lasting around six hours,
            followed by a period of sweating and fever relief – as well as
            headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle pain. Children
            tend to have more general symptoms: fever, cough, vomiting, and
            diarrhea
            <br />
            Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria
            species—are similar to flu-like symptoms,and can resemble other
            conditions such as sepsis, gastroenteritis, and viral diseases. The
            presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain,
            vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine,
            retinal damage, and convulsions.
            <br />
            The classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of
            sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating,
            occurring every two days (tertian fever) in P. vivax and P. ovale
            infections, and every three days (quartan fever) for P. malariae. P.
            falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every 36–48 hours, or
            a less pronounced and almost continuous fever

            Due to the non-specific nature of malaria symptoms, diagnosis is
            typically suspected based on symptoms and travel history, then
            confirmed with a parasitological test. In areas where malaria is
            common, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends clinicians
            suspect malaria in any person who reports having fevers, or who has
            a current temperature above 37.5 °C without any other obvious
            cause.Malaria should similarly be suspected in children with signs
            of anemia: pale palms or a laboratory test showing hemoglobin levels
            below 8 grams per deciliter of blood.In areas with little to no
            malaria, the WHO recommends only testing people with possible
            exposure to malaria (typically travel to a malaria-endemic area) and
            unexplained fever.

            Malaria is treated with antimalarial medications; the ones used
            depends on the type and severity of the disease.While medications
            against fever are commonly used, their effects on outcomes are not
            clear.Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce
            childhood deaths when used appropriately. Programmes which
            presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may
            lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of
            fever. Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can
            help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.

            Malaria is caused by infection with parasites in the genus
            Plasmodium.In humans, malaria is caused by six Plasmodium species:
            P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, P.
            vivax and P. knowlesi.Among those infected, P. falciparum is the
            most common species identified (~75%) followed by P. vivax
            (~20%).Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the
            majority of deaths,recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is
            associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as
            often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection.P. vivax
            proportionally is more common outside Africa.There have been
            documented human infections with several species of Plasmodium from
            higher apes; however, except for P. knowlesi—a zoonotic species that
            causes malaria in macaques—these are mostly of limited public health
            importance.
            <br />
            Parasites are typically introduced by the bite of an infected
            Anopheles mosquito. What these inoculated parasites, called
            "sporozoites", do in the skin and lymphatics, exactly, has yet to be
            accurately determined.However, a percentage of sporozoites follow
            the bloodstream to the liver, where they invade hepatocytes.They
            grow and divide in the liver for 2–10 days, with each infected
            hepatocyte eventually harboring up to 40,000 parasites.The infected
            hepatocytes break down, releasing this invasive form of Plasmodium
            cells, called "merozoites" into the bloodstream. In the blood, the
            merozoites rapidly invade individual red blood cells, replicating
            over 24–72 hours to form 16–32 new merozoites.The infected red blood
            cell lyses, and the new merozoites infect new red blood cells,
            resulting in a cycle that continuously amplifies the number of
            parasites in an infected person.

              Methods used to prevent malaria include medications, mosquito
              elimination and the prevention of bites. As of 2020, there is one
              vaccine for malaria (known as RTS,S) which is licensed for
              use.The presence of malaria in an area requires a
              combination of high human population density, high Anopheles
              mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from
              humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of
              these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite eventually disappears
              from that area, as happened in North America, Europe, and parts of
              the Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from
              the whole world, it could re-establish if conditions revert to a
              combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore,
              the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with
              decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible
              in some areas
              <br />
              In areas where malaria is common, children under five years old
              often have anaemia, which is sometimes due to malaria. Giving
              children with anaemia in these areas preventive antimalarial
              medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but does not
              affect the risk of death or need for hospitalisation
