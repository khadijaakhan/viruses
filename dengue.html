            <strong>Dengue</strong> (DENG-gey) fever is a mosquito-borne illness
            that occurs in tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Mild
            dengue fever causes a high fever and flu-like symptoms. The severe
            form of dengue fever, also called dengue hemorrhagic fever, can
            cause serious bleeding, a sudden drop in blood pressure (shock) and
            death. Millions of cases of dengue infection occur worldwide each
            year. Dengue fever is most common in Southeast Asia, the western
            Pacific islands, Latin America and Africa. But the disease has been
            spreading to new areas, including local outbreaks in Europe and
            southern parts of the United States.

            Researchers are working on dengue fever vaccines. For now, in areas
            where dengue fever is common, the best ways to prevent infection are
            to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take steps to reduce the
            mosquito population.

            Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection.
            When symptoms do occur, they may be mistaken for other illnesses —
            such as the flu — and usually begin four to 10 days after you are
            bitten by an infected mosquito. Dengue fever causes a high fever —
            104 F (40 C) — and any of the following signs and symptoms:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>Headache</li>
              <li>Muscle, bone or joint pain</li>
              <li>Nausea</li>
              <li>Vomiting</li>
              <li>Pain behind the eyes</li>
              <li>Swollen glands</li>
              <li>Rash</li>
            </ul>
            Most people recover within a week or so. In some cases, symptoms
            worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe
            dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe
            dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And
            the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream
            drops. This can lead to shock, internal bleeding, organ failure and
            even death. Warning signs of severe dengue fever — which is a
            life-threatening emergency — can develop quickly. The warning signs
            usually begin the first day or two after your fever goes away, and
            may include:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>Severe stomach pain</li>
              <li>Persistent vomiting</li>
              <li>Bleeding from your gums or nose</li>
              <li>Blood in your urine, stools or vomit</li>
              <li>Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising</li>
              <li>Difficult or rapid breathing</li>
              <li>Fatigue</li>
              <li>Irritability or restlessness</li>

            Diagnosing dengue fever can be difficult because its signs and
            symptoms can be easily confused with those of other diseases — such
            as chikungunya, Zika virus, malaria and typhoid fever. <br />Your
            doctor will likely ask about your medical and travel history. Be
            sure to describe international trips in detail, including the
            countries you visited and the dates, as well as any contact you may
            have had with mosquitoes.<br />Your doctor may also draw a sample of
            blood to be tested in a lab for evidence of infection with one of
            the dengue viruses.

            No specific treatment for dengue fever exists.<br />
            <br />While recovering from dengue fever, drink plenty of fluids.
            Call your doctor right away if you have any of the following signs
            and symptoms of dehydration:
            <ul class="mt-5 mb-5">
              <li>Decreased urination</li>
              <li>Few or no tears</li>

              <li>Lethargy or confusion</li>
              <li>Cold or clammy extremities</li>
            </ul>

            The over-the-counter (OTC) drug acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can
            help reduce muscle pain and fever. But if you have dengue fever, you
            should avoid other OTC pain relievers, including aspirin, ibuprofen
            (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). These pain
            relievers can increase the risk of dengue fever bleeding
            complications.<br />
            <br />If you have severe dengue fever, you may need:
            <ul class="mt-5">
              <li>Supportive care in a hospital</li>
              <li>Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte replacement</li>

            Dengue fever is caused by any one of four types of dengue viruses.
            You can't get dengue fever from being around an infected person.
            Instead, dengue fever is spread through mosquito bites. The two
            types of mosquitoes that most often spread the dengue viruses are
            common both in and around human lodgings. When a mosquito bites a
            person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito.
            Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus
            enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection. After
            you've recovered from dengue fever, you have long-term immunity to
            the type of virus that infected you — but not to the other three
            dengue fever virus types. This means you can be infected again in
            the future by one of the other three virus types. Your risk of
            developing severe dengue fever increases if you get dengue fever a
            second, third or fourth time.

            <h4>Vaccines</h4>
            <p>
              In areas of the world where dengue fever is common, one dengue
              fever vaccine (Dengvaxia) is approved for people ages 9 to 45 who
              have already had dengue fever at least once. The vaccine is given
              in three doses over the course of 12 months. <br />The vaccine is
              approved only for people who have a documented history of dengue
              fever or who have had a blood test that shows previous infection
              with one of the dengue viruses — called seropositivity. In people
              who have not had dengue fever in the past (seronegative),
              receiving the vaccine appears to increase the risk of severe
              dengue fever and hospitalization due to dengue fever in the
              future. <br />Dengvaxia is not available for travelers or for
              people who live in the continental United States. But in 2019, the
              U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for people
              ages 9 to 16 who have had dengue fever in the past and who live in
              the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico and the
              U.S. Virgin Islands — where dengue fever is common.
            </p>
            <h4>Prevent mosquito bites</h4>
            <p>
              The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an
              effective tool on its own to reduce dengue fever in areas where
              the illness is common. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling
              the mosquito population are still the main methods for preventing
              the spread of dengue fever. If you live in or travel to an area
              where dengue fever is common, these tips may help reduce your risk
              of mosquito bites:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Stay in air-conditioned or well-screened housing. The mosquitoes
                that carry the dengue viruses are most active from dawn to dusk,
                but they can also bite at night.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wear protective clothing. When you go into mosquito-infested
                areas, wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, socks and shoes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Use mosquito repellent. Permethrin can be applied to your
                clothing, shoes, camping gear and bed netting. You can also buy
                clothing made with permethrin already in it. For your skin, use
                a repellent containing at least a 10% concentration of DEET.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduce mosquito habitat. The mosquitoes that carry the dengue
                virus typically live in and around houses, breeding in standing
                water that can collect in such things as used automobile tires.
                You can help lower mosquito populations by eliminating habitats
                where they lay their eggs. At least once a week, empty and clean
                containers that hold standing water, such as planting
                containers, animal dishes and flower vases. Keep standing water
                containers covered between cleanings.
              </li>
