            <strong>Coronaviruses</strong> are a group of related RNA viruses
            that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they
            cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to
            lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common
            cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly
            rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and
            COVID-19, which is causing the ongoing pandemic. In cows and pigs
            they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and
            encephalomyelitis.
            <br />
            Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the
            family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria.They are
            enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome
            and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.The genome size of
            coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of
            the largest among RNA viruses.They have characteristic club-shaped
            spikes that project from their surface, which in electron
            micrographs create an image reminiscent of the stellar corona, from
            which their name derives.

            COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected
            people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without
            hospitalization.
            <br />
            Most common symptoms:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>fever</li>
              <li>cough</li>
              <li>tiredness</li>
              <li>lost of taste of smell</li>
            </ul>
            Less common symptoms:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>headache</li>
              <li>aches and pains</li>
              <li>diarrhoea</li>
              <li>a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes</li>
              <li>red or irritated eyes.</li>
              <li>sore throat</li>
            </ul>
            Serious symptoms:
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>difficulty breathing or shortness of breath</li>
              <li>loss of speech or mobility, or confusion</li>
              <li>chest pain.</li>
            </ul>
            Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.
            Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. People
            with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their
            symptoms at home. On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is
            infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up
            to 14 days.

            If you test positive and are more likely to get very sick from
            COVID-19, treatments are availableexternal icon that can reduce your
            chances of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. Medications
            to treat COVID-19 must be prescribed by a healthcare provider and
            started as soon as possible after diagnosis to be effective. Contact
            a healthcare provider right away to determine if you are eligible
            for treatment, even if your symptoms are mild right now.
            <br />
            Don’t delay: Treatment must be started within days of when you first
            develop symptoms to be effective.
            <br />
            People who are more likely to get very sick include older adults
            (ages 50 years or more, with risk increasing with age), people who
            are unvaccinated, and people with certain medical conditions, such
            as chronic lung disease, heart disease, or a weakened immune system.
            Being vaccinated makes you much less likely to get very sick. Still,
            some vaccinated people, especially those ages 65 years or older or
            who have other risk factors for severe disease, may benefit from
            treatment if they get COVID-19. A healthcare provider will help
            decide which treatment, if any, is right for you. Check with your
            healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are taking other
            medications to make sure the COVID-19 treatments can be safely taken
            at the same time.

            Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or
            SARS-CoV-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
            <br />
            The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people. Data has
            shown that the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person
            among those in close contact. The virus spreads by respiratory
            droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes,
            breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in
            the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.
            <br />
            Sometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to
            very small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several
            minutes or hours — called airborne transmission.
            <br />
            The virus can also spread if you touch a surface with the virus on
            it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.
            <br />
            The COVID-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has
            no symptoms. This is called asymptomatic transmission. The COVID-19
            virus can also spread from someone who is infected but hasn't
            developed symptoms yet. This is called presymptomatic transmission.
            <br />
            It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once.
            <br />
            When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of
            the original virus. The omicron (B.1.1.529) variant spreads more
            easily than the original virus that causes COVID-19 and the delta
            variant. However, omicron appears to cause less severe disease.
            People who are fully vaccinated can get breakthrough infections and
            spread the virus to others. But the COVID-19 vaccines are effective
            at preventing severe illness. This variant also reduces the
            effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments. Omicron has a
            few major offshoots (sublineages), including BA.5 and BA.2.12.1.
            BA.5 made up about 88% of COVID-19 infections that had genetic
            sequencing in the U.S. in August, 2022, according to the CDC.
            <br />
            In April, the CDC downgraded the delta variant from a variant of
            concern to a variant being monitored. This means that the delta
            variant isn’t currently considered a major public health threat in
            the U.S.

            Check with your local health authority for the most relevant
            guidance for your region.
            <br />
            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
            <br />
            <ul class="mt-2">
              <li>
                Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if
                they don’t appear to be sick.
              </li>
              <li>
                Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical
                distancing is not possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a
                window if indoors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based
                hand rub.
              </li>
              <li>
                Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about
                vaccination.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when
                you cough or sneeze.
              </li>
              <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
            </ul>
            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
            attention. Call in advance so your healthcare provider can direct
            you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents
            the spread of viruses and other infections.
            <br />
            Masks
            <br />
            Properly fitted masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from
            the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect
            against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing
            and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health
            authority.
